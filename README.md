## Overview
SMWresume is a personal resume or portfolio project designed to showcase skills, experiences, and achievements. It was built primarily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to view in any modern web browser without additional dependencies. This repository can serve as a template for individuals looking to create their own responsive, visually appealing resume websites. By hosting it on GitHub Pages (or any other static web hosting platform), you can quickly share your professional profile online.

## Features
- Responsive layout optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Clear section structure for work experience, education, projects, skills, and contact information.
- Easy customization of styles, colors, and layout, thanks to the organized CSS structure.
- Minimal external library usage, reducing complexity and dependencies.
- Straightforward file organization for easier maintenance and updates.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the semantic structure and content organization.
- **CSS**: Styles the layout, typography, and visual elements consistently across all pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactive functionality, such as animations or dynamic content.

## Getting Started
